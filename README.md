# Pokemon_Recreation_With_Map_Editor

This project had a ton of technical debt from me coding it so poorly back in college (2020). I was only just learning Java (& programming) back then and wrote a lot of code and looking back I'm honestly impressed how much I did with how inexperienced I was with Java. I've gotten so much better at programming in the past 3 years I find its difficult to resist coming back to this project and improving the code.
I revisit the project every once and awhile to refactor and try out new things I've learned.
I don't think this code base is in anyway indicitive of my codeing prowess whatsoever. And perhaps that's why I feel like refactoring it so much, but it is still something I'm proud of that has taught me A LOT, including many examples of how NOT to write code!

Welcome to Pokemon Recreation with an additional map editor!!!
<br>
<br>
The code base is moreso a framework for building a game, rather than a game itself.
The game is fully resizable and can be resized in realtime while the game is running with no problem, so make the window whatever size feels most comfortable! It should still be usable even at almost Apple watch sizes. Try it out, see how small you can make it while still being functional XD.
<br>
<br>
You can enter & exit EDIT_MODE via: ctrl+e.
<br>
<br>
While in EDIT_MODE you can click on cells to change their type.
<br>
<br>
You can visit other locations by walking over a Warp cell! To see some warp cells, enter Edit mode by pressing: ctrl+e. Then, look for the green cells.
<br>
<br>
You can move around using the keys: w, a, s, d.
<br>
<br>
You can change your speed by pressing: ctrl+i to decrease, ctrl+d increase.
<br>
<br>
You can open the Start menu by pressing: m.
<br>
<br>
There's even more than that! Like Wild POKeMON, an itemshop, & POKeMON battles!
<br>
<br>
That's Everything!
