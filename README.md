# Pokemon_Recreation_With_Map_Editor

Welcome to Pokemon Recreation with an additional map editor!!!
<br>
The game is fully resizable so make the window whatever size feels most comfortable! It should still be usable 
even at almost Apple watch sizes. Give it a try, see how small you can make it while still being functional XD.
<br>
You can enter & exit EDIT_MODE via: ctrl+e.
<br>
While in EDIT_MODE you can click on cells to change their type.
<br>
You can visit other locations by walking over a Warp cell! To see some warp cells,
 enter Edit mode by pressing: ctrl+e. Then, look for the green cells.
<br>
You can move around using the keys: w, a, s, d.
<br>
You can change your speed by pressing: ctrl+i to decrease, ctrl+d increase.
<br>
You can open the Start menu by pressing: m.
<br>
That's Everything!
